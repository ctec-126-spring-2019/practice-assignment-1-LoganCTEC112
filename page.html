    <h1>Intro to Logan</h1>
    <p>My name is Logan Duncan, I'm 30 years old and am enrolled at Clark College in the Web Development program. I'm
        fairly new to programming but I love learning rule based systems and most things click. I do sometimes have
        trouble remembering the right syntax for each language, but with practice, I will get better each day.</p>
    <p>In this class I want to learn a strong foundation of JavaScript skills to ensure good coding habits with this new
        language.</p>
    <p>My level of programming is intermediate. I know a couple languages and would say I am only averagely profiecent
        at each of them, though I would say I am good at keeping my code organized.</p>
    <h4>Known Languages</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
    </ul>
